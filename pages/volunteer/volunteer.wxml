        The bazaar is looking for you!
        In 2020 and 2021, the bazaar could not take place on the embassy grounds due to the pandemic. At the same time, the German community in Beijing has shrunk, which also poses great challenges for the Bazaarâ€™s organizing team. In order for the bazaar to take place again in 2022 and in the coming years in its traditional form, helpers are still urgently needed.
